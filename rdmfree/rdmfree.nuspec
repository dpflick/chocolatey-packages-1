    <summary>Centralize, Manage and Secure Access to Remote Connections</summary>
    <description>Remote Desktop Manager (RDM) centralizes all remote connections on a single platform that is securely shared between users and across the entire team. With support for hundreds of integrated technologies — including multiple protocols and VPNs — along with built-in enterprise-grade password management tools, global and granular-level access controls, and robust mobile apps to complement desktop clients for Windows and Mac, RDM is a Swiss Army knife for remote access. RDM empowers IT departments to drive security, speed and productivity throughout the organization, while reducing inefficiency, cost and risk.

###New versions possible checksums error (no panic)
**Authors do not provide specific URLs for each version, so the download URL in this package will always download the latest version. Please be patience if you get checksums failure, probably due to lag between official release and new Chocolatey package. I'll try to update as soon as possible, but you can try --ignore-checksums parameter to bypass the error or, better, warn me in comments section here or by opening a GitHub issue. Thank you.**
